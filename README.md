I made this game in middle school. It is a cool concept and it looks cool, but I guess I only made the menu screen and not any actual levels. I'm archiving this because it's cool and I'm not going to work on it anymore.

Also it seems like I locked it to 60fps since it looks very choppy on a 144Hz monitor. I think I actually may not have known that >60Hz screens exist.
